## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. I chose to avoid redux as it was overkill for such a small application, and instead just kept state in App.js. In addition, if we were talking about 1000s of tweets, I would have looked to normalise the state, but again as we're talking about 10 tweets, I chose to skip this.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
